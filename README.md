# ReactNative-MyGallery

It's my own custom album made with React Native.<br/>
I'm saving albums and images using Asyncstorage, so it's still there when i turn app back on.<br/>
If you click adding album button, you write album name and save album.<br/>
Also if you click adding image button, you choice image in your mobile album.<br/>
And if you clicked image, you can see image pop-up.<br/>
This image pop-up include move to previous image button and next image button.<br/>
Addtional if you long press from image or album, you can deleting it.
